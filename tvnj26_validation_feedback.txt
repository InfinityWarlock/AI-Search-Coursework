Feedback for user-ID tvnj26

Throughout this validation, as many error messages as possible are returned in order to help you understand what might have gone wrong.
However, note that sometimes a single error might lead to early termination of the validation process so that fixing this error results
in more, as yet unseen errors. So, the list of error messages might not be exhaustive but its the best I can do.

The first part of this feedback is validation of the program files that you submitted, in terms of the key information they need to contain.
At this stage, the programs are not executed; that will follow later. Please note that for any program cluster, if any of
the following are true then the program cluster is INVALID and neither it nor the tours it produces will secure any marks:
 - the basic program does not exist
 - the basic program exists but its user-name mis-matches the definitive user-name
 - the basic program exists but its algorithm code is illegal
 - the basic program exists but it imports an illegal module
 - the enhanced program exists but its user-name mismatches the definitive user-name
 - the enhanced program exists but its algorithm code mis-matches with that of the basic program
 - the enhanced program exists but it imports an illegal module.
Also, if you have two valid program clusters but they have the same algorithm code then both clusters are invalid.
(Of course, invalidity can be avoided if you check your programs using this program prior to submission!)

#####  Program submission
#####   * program cluster AlgA:
#####      - AlgAbasic.py: the program file has successfully been validated (genetic algorithm, tariff 6)
#####      - AlgAenhanced.py: the program file has successfully been validated (genetic algorithm, tariff 6)
#####   * program cluster AlgB:
#####      - AlgBbasic.py: the program file has successfully been validated (ant colony optimization, tariff 9)
#####      - AlgBenhanced.py: there were validation errors
#####         *** error: the program file does not exist

The next part of this feedback is validation of the tour files that you submitted. Each has been validated and the outcome is described below.
If any tour has an associated error message then it is deemed to be invalid and it will secure no marks. Remember: as stated above, any tours
arising from an invalid program cluster will not secure any marks (irrespective of whether they are actually legal tours or not). The tour
lengths of successfully validated tours given below go to form your tour-quality mark.

The next part of this feedback simply states whether or not the proforma was submitted. There is no penalty for not submitting the proforma but
no enhancement marks will be awarded without a proforma.

#####  Additional items submission
