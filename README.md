# AI-Search-Coursework

This coursework was completed for the Artificial Intelligence module of my degree at Durham University

The submitted content is in the folder 'tvnj26'

The aim of this coursework was to use heuristic search algorithms to solve the travelling salesman problem.
I created a genetic algorithm (alg A) and an ant colony optimisation algorithm (alg B). See comments in code written by professor to distinguish code I wrote and code he wrote.
The graphs the algorithms were applied to are in the folder 'city-files'.

Mark received: 71/100
